<h1>Resume</h1>

<ul class="resumeList">
	<h3>Education</h3>
	<ul>			
		<li class="noBulletList">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently studying at Drexel University
		. My major is in computer engineering, my current cumulative GPA is 2.86, and my expected
		graduation year is 2016.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Job Experience</h3>
	<ul>			
		<li class="noBulletList">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far I have had two six-month experiences through Drexel’s Co-op system. Both of these were at Comcast, working in a satellite location based in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey. Though my title was the same, Deployment Engineering Co-op, both six-month stints were quite different.
		</li>
		<li class="noBulletList">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During both Co-ops I worked with two teams, a Data Center Deployment team, and a Cell Backhaul Deployment team. The work for both teams was different, most of the data center work that I did resulted in me mounting servers into cabinets in data centers, and then powering them on. On top of that I was also responsible for the preventative maintenance tickets, and making sure that our team, and the on call centers knew when work was happening in the live data centers.	</li>
		<li class="noBulletList">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cell backhaul team I was responsible for evaluating business analytics data, as well as running weekly and monthly reports, to which I did automated with VBA macros in excel. I also kept track of the inventory for their team. </li>
		<li class="noBulletList">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my time at Comcast there were Co-op centric projects that were required. I was quite involved in the second one, setting up meetings and leading calls for our team. The project required us to talk to senior executives of the company about how Comcast’s internal metrics are being handled, collect the results, and present something fresh back to them at the end of our time there. This overall was a great experience, both professionally and educationally. It really helps individuals like the interns and Co-ops learn how business is run at the higher levels at the company.</li>
